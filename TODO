* Things To Do

** TODO Sprites
   Encapsulates an image and all of its transformations: position,
   rotation, scale, color, etc.

** TODO Sprite batches
   Efficiently render a large number of sprites. Only change OpenGL
   context when necessary. For example, don't change texture when
   rendering several sprites in a row that use the same one.

** TODO Tilesets
   Break an image up into many small pieces. Useful for creating maps.

   (make-tileset image tile-width tile-height padding margin)

** TODO Tileset animations
   Given a tileset, an animated sequence of frames can be created.

   (make-animation tileset frame-duration frames)

** TODO Tile maps
   Create a loader for Tiled .tmx map files.

** TODO Scene graph
   A tree structure that is traversed when rendering a game scene.
   The graph is composed of groups and nodes. Transformations are
   accumulated as the tree is walked.

** TODO Scripting
   Provide a way for users to easily script 2D games using coroutines
   (green threads)
